    Hour 0-1: Use Spring Initializr to generate the project. 
    Choose Java 21, Maven, and add Spring Web and Spring Data JPA (if you need a database).

    Hour 1-3: Build your Data Model (the objects) and Controllers (the API). 
    Use the AI to generate the boilerplate classes based on your requirements.

    Hour 3-5: Connect the Javascript frontend. Since they'll be on different ports, 
    remember to add the @CrossOrigin annotation to your Controller to avoid security blocks.

    Hour 5-6: Final testing and "Daemonizing." 
    To run it as a background service (daemon) on Linux, you can simply use nohup java -jar yourapp.jar &.
